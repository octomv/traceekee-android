# OpenTrace Android app

![alt text](./OpenTrace.png "OpenTrace Logo")

OpenTrace is the open source reference implementation of BlueTrace.
BlueTrace is a privacy-preserving protocol for community-driven contact tracing across borders. It allows participating devices to log Bluetooth encounters with each other, in order to facilitate epidemiological contact tracing while protecting usersâ€™ personal data and privacy. Visit https://bluetrace.io to learn more.
The OpenTrace reference implementation comprises:
- Android app: [opentrace-community/opentrace-android](https://github.com/opentrace-community/opentrace-android)
- iOS app: [opentrace-community/opentrace-ios](https://github.com/opentrace-community/opentrace-ios)
- Cloud functions: [opentrace-community/opentrace-cloud-functions](https://github.com/opentrace-community/opentrace-cloud-functions)
- Calibration: [opentrace-community/opentrace-calibration](https://github.com/opentrace-community/opentrace-calibration)

## Setup of the app
To get started on the app, setup and configure the following:
1. ./gradle.properties
2. ./app/build.gradle
3. Firebase - google-services.json
4. Remote configs
5. Protocol version

### Build Configurations in build.gradle
Change the package name and other configurations accordingly such as the `resValue` in  in the different settings in `buildTypes`
For example,
```groovy
buildTypes {
    debug {
            buildConfigField "String", "FIREBASE_UPLOAD_BUCKET", STAGING_FIREBASE_UPLOAD_BUCKET
            buildConfigField "String", "BLE_SSID", STAGING_SERVICE_UUID

            String ssid = STAGING_SERVICE_UUID
            versionNameSuffix "-debug-${getGitHash()}-${ssid.substring(ssid.length() - 5,ssid.length() - 1 )}"
            resValue "string", "app_name", "OpenTrace Debug"
            applicationIdSuffix "stg"
        }
```

> Values such as STAGING_FIREBASE_UPLOAD_BUCKET, STAGING_SERVICE_UUID have been defined in gradle.properties as described above.

---

### Firebase and google-services.json
Setup Firebase for the different environment.
Download the google-services.json for each of the environments and put it in the corresponding folder.

Debug: ./app/src/debug/google-services.json

Production: ./app/src/release/google-services.json

The app currently relies on Firebase Functions to work. More information can be obtained by referring to [opentrace-cloud-functions](https://github.com/opentrace-community/opentrace-cloud-functions).

---

### Remote Config
Remote config is used for retrieving the "Share" message used in the app.
The key for it is "ShareText". If it is unable to be retrieved, it falls back to R.string.share_message

---

### Protocol Version
Protocol version used should be 2 (or above)
Version 1 of the protocol has been deprecated

---

### Security Enhancements
SSL pinning is not included as part of the repo.
It is recommended to add in a check for SSL certificate returned by the backend.
