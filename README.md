## Setup and configuration

Please refer to the setup and configuration documentation on the
[Open Trace repository](https://github.com/opentrace-community/opentrace-android)

Slight changes were made to the structure of `app/build.gradle` for the sake of transparency in order to leave all build variables publicly visible except for credentials.
